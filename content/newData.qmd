Identify Additional Data
Identify which additional data (regional-specific or other species-specific data) weâ€™d want tools for to help predict movements and move towards addressing climate-related questions.

Consider adding a chart with new data to consider (data name, description, link). Possibly add info on how other people can submit a recommendation (perhaps by an issue or sending an email??)
