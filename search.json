It looks like a html book (type: book) but unlike the book type it only has html format and you will not have the download options. type: website is a common format for documentation.\nThe repo includes a GitHub Action that will build the website automatically when you make changes to the files. The webpage will use the gh-pages branch. Serving the website files from this branch is a common way to keep all the website files from cluttering your main branch.\nWarning: Check that the settings will allow the GitHub Action to run. See the instructions below under “GitHub Set-up”. Scroll down to the troubleshooting section if the website is not built by the GitHub Action.\nNote: The GitHub Action installs R so you can render qmd files with R code. You will need to edit to install Python or Julia if your qmd uses those instead. If you have substantial computations, you don’t want to be re-running all the computations for files that didn’t change. Read about the freeze option for this situation. R users with complex reports with dependencies (so qmd B depends on qmd A or data file A) should be aware of the {targets} package which will help you keep track of files that need to be re-rendered due to changes in dependencies.\n\n\n\nClick the green “Use This Template” button to make a repository with this content.

As an example, we will change the “/content/Hardware.qmd” file. First, read the information in the page to understand the intended content. To start, we will organize different subheadings within this page.\nIdentify Sub-Headings. In this example, we will want to identify different types of Hardware used by our particular lab. In this example, we will want the following categories: “PAM Gliders”, “Drifting Recorders”, “Towed Arrays”, and “Handheld Hydrophones”.\n\nUsing the Source editor, use # to indicate Heading 1 style, ## for Heading 2 Style, etc.\nUsing the Visual editor, use the dropdown menu to select the Heading Style\n\nAdd Content. Most content will consist of text, with some images, hyperlinks, and occasional tables. To start, we recommend identifying the content you would like to put in there, and identify the Point of Contact (POC). As an example, we may put the following text:\nPOC: Jane Doe. General description of Hardware, links to online content (vendor specification page, relevant online content), instructions for build or maintain hardware (or links to that information), links to inventory, etc.\nOnce your outline is developed, fill in the content. IF someone else will collate the content– they can create it in a separate document to be copied/pasted here, or they can directly modify this page.\nIf you find you need separate pages for each sub-heading (instead of one long subheading), then create New Content, and link the new content to the _quarto.yml.\nWhen you are finished modifying your document and Project, push changes to Github using Github Desktop (see instructions here)."

All regions will submit and format their humpback detection data into the Passive Acoustic Cetacean Map (PACM)/Makara database.\nThis workflow will allow for a national comparison of one species to be able to identify and compare changes (or lack thereof) within and across regions. Once this structure has been established, these standardized data formats, tools, and environmental data streams can be applied across the range of project goals and regional needs, including regional-specific high-profile species.

If you use Python or Julia instead, then you will need to update the GitHub Action to install those.\nIf getting the GitHub Action to work is too much hassle (and that definitely happens), you can alway render locally and publish to the gh-pages branch. If you do this, make sure to delete or rename the GitHub Action to something like\nrender-and-publish.old_yml\nso GitHub does not keep trying to run it. Nothing bad will happen if you don’t do this, but if you are not using the action (because it keeps failing), then you don’t need GitHub to run it."
